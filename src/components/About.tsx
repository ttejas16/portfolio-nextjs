                            In 2019 completed my 10 school years from PES Modern English Medium High School Pune, India.
                            Didn't do much in those days to be honest but the last 4 years were the best of my life. Hanging out with friends,
                            studying without any worries about jobs and stuff,this was the best!!.
                        </p>

                            After school clueless me decided to take Science as major. The next two years were the 'not so good' years of whatever life
                            I had lived at that point. The pandemic situation keeps getting worse. But after completing those two years in college I decided to take a Computer Science Degree. Maybe my love for video games especially mobile games lead me to that descision.

                        <p className="leading-[1.5em]">
                            In the next 3 years of my CS Degree I learned much more things about programming from the very basics to topics like
                            Data Structures and many more. The first ever programming language I learned was C. Using this knowledge I kept learning
                            even more new things and started Web Development.
